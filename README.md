# Scent Angels
We have created a website that uses machine learning to predict a perfume’s popularity based on certain perfume features: accord, notes, sillage etc. and have built a “Perfume Designer” App where you can create your perfume and see if it would be popular or not.
Check out a brief introduction to our website development, here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kLpmB_BrK-Ui5TlWWvtS06L78TBK4_cAGl9DQRv548c/edit#slide=id.gbf44f01a53_0_25
