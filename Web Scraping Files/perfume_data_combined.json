Daphne Bugey and Fabrice Pellegrin. It\u2019s not their first tango.\nShe says \"freedom is to be unafraid\".\nHe has his own motto engraved on the back of his watch, \"carpe diem\", as if to better savour the scandal he created with his partner in crime. Languidly pleasing pleats, round hips and a tiny waist,legs akimbo the up side is down. A handmade scandal. A pink sap courses through this objet, like the life juice of a dangerously irresistible fruit. The design, the drapery, this bottle sets the scene for a story that is meant to be written all through the night and maybe even into day break. Trouble and troubling sensations guaranteed. The color of a grand cru, intensely raspberry, almost bordeaux.\nVelvety shades. For a colour that colours the night with couture, sound in two parts: SoScandal! by Jean Paul Gaultier.

Gucci Bloom was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top note is Jasmine; middle note is Tuberose; base note is Rangoon creeper. Gucci Bloom: Debuting the First Fragrance by Alessandro Michele: \u201cI wanted a green fragrance, a courageous scent that transports you to a vastgarden filled with many flowers and plants, a bouquet of abundance. The garden is as beautiful as women are; colorful, wild, diverse, where there is everything. GucciBloom smells of this garden in order to travel to a place that is not there,\u201d Alessandro Michele. Flowering from the authentic spirit of the women Alessandro Michele champions is an attitude of freedom to be who you want to be. Mixed with the color, decoration and pattern of the creative director\u2019s design canon, the women he dresses are flourishing in a natural, expressive and individual way: they are in bloom. The first Gucci fragrance developed wholly under Alessandro Michele\u2019s creative vision encapsulates this modern philosophy that is the guiding vision for the House.\nGucci Bloom celebrates the authenticity, vitality and diversity of the women he designs for, and those that identify themselves in his vision. True to who they are, these young women experience life and its fruits, blooming into their real selves. They convey their personal point-of-view without conventional limitations. They live for memorable experiences, to create stories and connect and be inspired by the objects, culture and art they choose to be surrounded by. Architect of every element of the scent, Alessandro Michele has infused Gucci Bloom\u2019s idea of lushness, life and vigor in each fragrant note, the dreamy campaign and its unconventional design.\n\u00a0\nABOUT THE SCENT:\u00a0 Blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas with direction from Alessandro Michele, the fragrance is created to unfold like its name. The creative director envisioned the scent as a thriving garden full of diverse types of flowers and the rich perfume it emits.\n\u00a0\nAuthenticity is woven through qualitative, highly-concentrated natural ingredients.\nNotes blossom out like a concentration of flowers, the unique expression of the new to the world ingredients, brings a new olfactory experience. Natural Tuberose absolute harvested from India is interlaced with natural Jasmine absolute. Jasmine bud extract, obtained through an exclusive method of co-extraction that blends a natural quality of jasmine and captive moleculesto impart a fresh green and petal scent on the skin. Gucci Bloom also features notes of another plant used in perfume-making for the first time, the Rangoon Creeper. Discovered in South India, the Rangoon Creeper embodies the new scent\u2019s concept and name, as it changes color from white, gradually darkens to pink then finally to red when it blooms. The vine\u2019s flowers are redolent with a slightly powdery feminine floral perfume. ABOUT THE DESIGN:\u00a0 An arbiter and seeker of beauty, Alessandro Michele ideated a flacon and packaging that encapsulates the fragrance\u2019s spirit dedicated to the diversity of women.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe bottle is not designed feminine to seduce men, but to keep company with the women who wear the perfume. Retro and tender because of its color, with clean, slender lines, and not crafted in transparent glass but in porcelain, a material that I love very much,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\nA vintage powder pink shades the lacquered porcelain square-shaped bottle, appliqu\u00e9d with the Gucci label ribbed and framed in black. The outer carton is covered inside and outside in Herbarium, a red-and-white toile de Jouy House print of leaves, cherry branches and flowers framed in black.\n\u00a0 ABOUT CAMPAIGN:\u00a0 Encapsulating the very meaning of Gucci Bloom, the campaign\u2019s idea is revealed through the contemporary women of Gucci: actress Dakota Johnson, actress and model Hari Nef and artist Petra Collins. Friends of Alessandro Michele, they have a special connection with the House, their talent resonating with Gucci\u2019s new vision. Their diverse individual beauty is shot by Glen Luchford, allowing them to radiate in the campaign\u2019s transformative setting. They wear Gucci Bloom during their day in the city, and it changes the surrounding urbanity into an imaginary stroll in a fantastical English garden. Tea on a sidewalk flourishing with blooms, walking in an apartment overgrown with verdant plants, and swimming at dusk in a lake entangled with shimmering flowers and reeds.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nDancing, strolling, rejoicing in being free and full of life: this trio embody Gucci\u2019s new vitality and the captivating, transporting nature of Gucci Bloom.\n\u00a0 The fragrance will be available as a 30, 50 and 100 ml Eau de Parfum.

This is a new fragrance. M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur was launched in 2019. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top notes are Chamomile and Bitter Almond; middle notes are Musk, Indian Jasmine and Jasmine; base notes are Sandalwood, Cedar and Vanilla. \u201cEverything comes from my obsession with scents: my memory is primarily olfactive so, for me, my sense of smell is my memory. I thought that, deep down, perfume is that thing that even with your eyes closed, brings you to a precise moment in space and time. When we began to work on Gucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur, I tried to imagine the recollection of a scent that couldn\u2019t easily be identified; a hybrid scent that resembles memory as much as possible,\u201d Alessandro Michele.\nScent is in our subconscious, attached to fragments of moments lived, coloring them with emotions of all-consuming joy, of intense love, or overwhelming sadness. A scent can gift a moment again, so an experience from the past can be relived in the now.\nFor a new Gucci fragrance story, scent becomes an explorer of the power of memories, bringing them back from the past and making them live in our present. Skipping backward and forward in chronological time, the present and past are connected by a unique bridge that projects directly into the future. Presenting a new universal Gucci scent. A perfume unassigned with a gender or a time. Presenting Gucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur.\nGucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur is an elixir that transcends gender by its individuality, to establish a new olfactive family, Mineral Aromatic. The transcendent accord features unexpected and enigmatic ingredients, and is defined by a note of Roman chamomile. Alessandro Michele envisioned this particular flower inside the scent, blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas.\nGucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur\u2019s Roman chamomile is structured with Indian Coral Jasmine petals for tenderness, precious musks for depth, and noble woods including warm, luminous sandalwood and airy, subtle cedarwood, a powerful tree with deep roots and an irresistible vanilla note.\nDisrupting the traditional olfactive families that classifies fragrances, Gucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur establishes a new modern fragrance category, Mineral, which is a mix of scents and emotions: airy, musky, transparent and authentic. Mineral was classically used to describe facets of some fragrances, and combined with Aromatic, it becomes the center of Gucci Memoire d\u2019une Odeur.\n\u201dThe musky mineral accord is the keystone of the fragrance: it links all the other olfactive elements together with pure softness,\u201d Alberto Morillas.\n\u201cI had to think quite carefully about why Alessandro chose chamomile. When I started to work with the scent of chamomile itself, then I understood,\u201d Morillas said. \u201cNo one had done it before. Chamomile is known all over the world. Everyone has smelt it at some point, but as a dream, a memory of childhood, something timeless, and never in a fragrance. This flower is much underestimated and is a plant with an exceptional olfactive signature.\u201d\nRoman Chamomile has grown around Rome in terraced gardens since the 16th and 17th centuries. Giving a green aromatic scent, the sunny and hardy flower has an unparalleled character, radiating with joy to a sweet aromatic dry down with honey and green apple.\nIndian Coral Jasmine Nature Print \u00ae : A note exclusive to Gucci, collected in India, the star-shaped flower emits a more powerful scent and colors at night, remaining lighter and fresher during the day. Referred to as Queen of the Night, the official flower of Bengal, this unique quality of jasmine has a honeyed temper and an orangey coral-colored heart.\nGucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur\u2019s dry down is an evanescent cloud, evolving on skin with a rhythm of Musks and iconic woods: Cedarwood and Sandalwood. The woody architecture of the fragrance brings intensity to its structure.\nAlessandro Michele discovered a vintage Gucci fragrance bottle, and was inspired by its design for Gucci M\u00e9moire d\u2019une Odeur\u2019s bottle. Grooved like a column from an ancient world, the bottle casts a refined silhouette in heavy transparent light green glass, crowned with shiny gold cap. Printed gold foil frames the label, revealing the Gucci logo together with the name of the fragrance.\n\u201cThe packaging comes from the past, inspired by an old Gucci perfume from the early 90s. I didn\u2019t want the bottle to take on a shape or size that is too feminine or too masculine because the perfume could be very much for women or very much for men,\u201d Alessandro Michele.\nSymbolizing a starry night sky and the earthly world that gazes up at it in marvel, the perfume\u2019s green box is decorated with Celestial firmaments inspired by the paintings of Roman and gothic churches of the Middle Ages and Renaissance in Europe. This particular pattern recalls Giotto\u2019s frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padova.\n\u201cThe guiding element of the entire campaign is the idea of freedom; the idea of the non-era, the non-place, the non-social. I pictured a world that was a fresco of a \u2018mythological\u2019 life in which the family is a private community with its own social framework where total freedom of expression prevails and where the roles of people and things aren\u2019t clear. I pictured the memory of an authentic memory,\u201d Alessandro Michele.\nA gathering of a free-spirited family, who embrace life by living freely and making memories together, an idea by Alessandro Michele. In diverse settings on the outskirts of Rome, the family are captured dancing, picnicking at sun kissed ruins of Canale Monterano, and in and around their family home, Montecalvello Castle\u2014a medieval castle featuring a fountain in a courtyard, and enigmatic frescoes inside and out. Director of the campaign Glen Luchford imbues the video and images with vibrant nostalgia, under the artistic direction of Christopher Simmonds. The print advertising campaign is composed like intimate photo albums, that show each member\u2019s character and their intimate rapport with one another.\nSinger, songwriter and actor Harry Styles leads the cast of the family, which includes an eclectic and universal mix of talents and models: Zumi Rosow (designer and musician), Ariana Papademetropoulos (artist), Stanislas Klossowski de Rola (actor and musician), Olimpia Dior (artist), Leslie Winer (model and musician), Thomas Riguelle (model), Tex Santos-Shaw (model), Tessa Bruinsma (model), Olga Zapivokhina (model), Oleg Ulrich (model), Mat\u00efss Rucko (model), Mae Lapres (model), William Valente (model), Katea Gramma (model), Unia Pakhomova (model), Ellia Sophia (model), Elibeidy Dani Martinez (model), Cheikh Tall (model), and Aaron Sirainen (model). The fragrance is available from August 1st 2019 as a 40m, 60ml and 100ml Eau de Parfum, and as a 30ml rollerball bottle.
